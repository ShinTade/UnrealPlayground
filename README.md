# UnrealPlayground
Project used for testing out different features and in-engine solutions in terms of **shaders, blueprints, various tricks** etc.

Most of the stuff found here was found across **youtube, various dev blogs** etc. With every new feature added I always double check the setup, add additional commetnts or even add my own stuff on top of it.
**UnrealPlayground** project is a aimed to be great **learning resource** and somewhat cheat-sheet when it comes to getting already setup materials and blueprints, ready to be migrated over to different project.
